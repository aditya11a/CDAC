Q1 Does ANSI recognize the data type DATE?

Ans. Yes, **ANSI SQL** (American National Standards Institute SQL) recognizes the `DATE` data type. In the **SQL:1992** (also known as SQL-92) standard and subsequent versions, the `DATE` data type was formally introduced and defined.The `DATE` data type is used to store calendar dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (year-month-day). It does not include time information, which is handled separately by data types like `TIME` or `TIMESTAMP` in ANSI SQL. So, for example, a `DATE` value might look like `'2024-10-13'`.

Q2 Which subdivision of SQL is used to insert values in tables?

The subdivision of SQL used to insert values into tables is DML (Data Manipulation Language).

DML includes commands that allow you to manipulate the data within database tables. The most common DML commands are:

INSERT: To insert new rows into a table.
UPDATE: To modify existing data in a table.
DELETE: To remove rows from a table.
SELECT: To retrieve data from tables.
